## Criteria Fulfillment
 - [x] FMCW Waveform Design
  * Description: Using the given system requirements, design a FMCW waveform. Find its Bandwidth (B), chirp time (Tchirp) and slope of the chirp.
  * Implementation: The implementation is from `Line 31 to Line 33`.
 - [x] Simulation Loop
  * Description: Simulate Target movement and calculate the beat or mixed signal for every timestamp.
  * 
 - [x] Range FFT (1st FFT)
  * Description: Implement the Range FFT on the Beat or Mixed Signal and plot the result.
  * 
 - [x] 2D CFAR
  * Description: Implement the 2D CFAR process on the output of 2D FFT operation, i.e the Range Doppler Map.
  * Implement steps:
    1.
